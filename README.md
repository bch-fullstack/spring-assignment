Spring Assignment 

Otso Lappalainen (Developer)
Mission statement:

Make a currilucum vitae (CV) page that is publishable to the public.  The aim is to make a ”living CV” that shows the developer’s basic level of front-end developemtn from animation to the entire fuctionality and visual austethics of the website so that the developer can apply to junior front-end developer positions or trainee positions with the site as an CV. The main emphasis is to show off HTML and CSS skills, but there is a slight use of Javascript (and Jquery) in the form of a back-to-top button available for clicks. There may be alternative external libraries used such as google fonts or awesome fonts, but these have not been set in stone and the current font being used for the project is century gothic.
The sprint will last 5 days from Sunday February 23rd to 28th Thursday. The daily hours used will range from 3 to 6 hours a day making the possible burndown chart very volatile. 

Day 1.
The aim for day one i to get the skeleton (core structure) of the website done. Simply making the html parts done with the copywritten text added as well. JS, CSS, Google Tag Manager and Michael Snik’s animate on scroll (AOS) feature.
The copywriting for the page has been completed from previous projects and can simply be copied to this new project. Images for the hero banner we’re selected as of writing the documentation and they include 2 professional photographs alongside 2 leisery photographs.
The biggest hurdle for day 1 sprint will be getting the html-elements done properly. There will be approximately 4 to 6 different div-containers all containing unique logos and text, but the structure will be same and therefore share class.
The footer will include an external link to the developer’s school email address and if given the opportunity also links to social media channels.

Day 2.

Main objective of day two is getting the CSS parts 100% accomplished. The CSS elements include but is not limited to: animations, image sizes, containers, hover effects, colors, backbrounds, viewport heights and widths, pixels, link elements, text elements, mobiline-friendliness, Call-to-action elements, etc. This will take approximately 6 to 9 hours to complete.  After this day the website should be visually 100% done.

Day 3.

3rd day will be used on making a critical review of the website as a whole. Does it look austethically pleasing? Is it up to modern standard’s for what is expected from a Junior front-end developer or trainee? How does the code look like? Are there any notes worth mentioning? What are the developers possibly thinking when reading the code or inspecting the elements? Does the console log find any errors? Is Google Tag Manager working as intended?
The other aspect of day three is making sure all the Javascript functions work from the hero-banner’s sliding images to the scroll-up button.
Depending on the amount of bugs, external library connections and so forward day three should be done in 6 to 9 hours.

Day 4 & 5.

Depending on the Spring burndown chart the last two days are just making sure is everything caught up. Did everything go as expected or were there any major issues that caused a longer time to create? Were there any errors or bugs that needed fixing or bad code in need of a re-write?
If everything looks good to go the developer will try and find aspiration to add further elements or features to the CV-website.

Conclusion.

For the developer this is a recap of all previous weeks of studying and putting them onto use in a span of five days. Therefore another core aspect of the project is to see how well the developer can utilise Github in work environment and how to handle a tight schedule with limited time.
